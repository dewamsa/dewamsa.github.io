I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Information Technology, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia. Since 2022, I have been a PhD student at Electronics and Information Engineering, Jeonbuk National University and received Higher Education for ASEAN Talents (HEAT) scholarship launched by Korean Council for University Education (KCUE). 

I was received my Bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science, Universitas Udayana, Indonesia in 2014. Then, I went to Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia for Master degree in Computer Science and finished it in 2016. Right after that, I got lucky served as research assistant in Laboratory of Computer Networks, Architectures, and Hyper Performance Computing, Universitas Indonesia for 2,5 year before joining Universitas Udayana.
