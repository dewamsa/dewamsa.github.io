> ## Abstract
> Hand signature is one of the human characteristics that humans have since birth, which can be used for identity recognition. A high accuracy signature recognition is needed to identify the correct owner of the signature. This study presents signature identification using a combination method between Deep Learning and Euclidean Distance. This study uses three different signature datasets are used in this study which consists of SigComp2009, SigComp2011, and private dataset. First, signature images are preprocessed using binary image conversion, Region of Interest, and thinning. The preprocessed image then has its feature extracted using DenseNet201 and further identified using Euclidean Distance. Several testing scenarios are also applied to measure proposed method robustness, such as using various Pretrained Deep Learning, dataset augmentation, and dataset split ratio modifiers. The best accuracy achieved is 99.44%, with a high precision rate.
